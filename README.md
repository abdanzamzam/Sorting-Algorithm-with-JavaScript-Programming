# Sorting Algorithm with JavaScript Programming
Sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output. 

Following are some sorting algorithms:
### 1. Buble Sort
It is the oldest sorting algorithm with the simplest sorting method. Sorting is done by comparing each item in a list in pairs, exchanging items if necessary, and repeating them to the end of the list sequentially, so that no more items can be exchanged.
